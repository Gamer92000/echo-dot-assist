# Changelog

What changed for people using the Echo, newest first. Details and measurements are in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## 2026-09-23

- **Alexa's original sounds** for the wake word, the action button, the volume keys and the mic-off button (mics off / mics
  on), taken from the stock firmware on the device. The generated blip is gone. The "Wake sound" switch in Home Assistant
  silences all of them.
- **Button sounds no longer drop out.** About a third of them were lost to a race in Amazon's mixer library; playback now
  waits for the mixer to take the sound before closing the stream.
- **Volume stays consistent.** Replies play on a separate volume (`TTSVolume`) that only followed the main volume when
  hassmic changed it. It is now kept in line every 2 s, and a main volume changed from outside is reported to Home
  Assistant and Music Assistant.
- **Diagnostics in Home Assistant**: SoC temperature and CPU usage as sensors, disabled by default. Enable them in the
  entity settings of the Echo Dot device.
- For developers: `kill -TTIN $(pidof hassmic)` writes what the wake word hears to `state/capture.raw`, the next one stops
  it. The only way to record the processed mic stream while hassmic runs.

## 2026-09-22

- **Wake word during alarms and playback.** hassmic now tells Amazon's wake word model when a timer rings, music plays or a
  reply is spoken, and the model switches to the lower accept threshold it carries for those moments ("Echo" needs a score
  of 0.45 instead of 0.75 while an alarm rings). Stopping an alarm or interrupting music by voice works from further away.
