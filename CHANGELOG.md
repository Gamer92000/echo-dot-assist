# Changelog

What changed for people using the Echo, newest first. Details and measurements are in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## 2026-09-24

- **Do not disturb, like Alexa's.** A new "Do not disturb" switch in Home Assistant. While it is on, announcements
  (`assist_satellite.announce`, "ask a question") are not played. Everything you start yourself still works: the wake
  word, replies, timers, music and the Bluetooth "Connected to …" message. Turning it on shows Alexa's single purple
  pulse on the ring. The setting survives restarts. For a schedule, use a Home Assistant automation, and you can switch
  it by voice if the switch is exposed to Assist.
- **"Connected to <phone>" like Alexa.** When a phone or computer connects to the Echo as a Bluetooth speaker, the Echo
  plays Amazon's Bluetooth chime and says "Connected to" and the device's name; on disconnect the other chime and
  "Disconnected from …". The words come from Home Assistant's text-to-speech, so Home Assistant has to let the Echo
  ask for it: Settings → Devices & services → ESPHome → the Echo → Configure → tick "Allow the device to perform Home
  Assistant actions" (until then only the chime plays, and Home Assistant shows a repair about it). The new
  "Bluetooth announcements" switch turns both chime and words off.
- **Bluetooth speaker again.** Phones and computers can play to the Echo over Bluetooth, beside the Bluetooth proxy.
  To pair, turn on the new "Bluetooth pairing" switch in Home Assistant and pick the Echo on the phone within two
  minutes; afterwards the phone connects by itself whenever you choose the Echo. Music from the phone is ducked while
  you talk to the assistant, and the wake word listens through it like through other music.
  Codecs: SBC like stock Alexa, and in addition AAC (what iPhones, iPads and Macs use), aptX and aptX HD. While a
  phone plays, the Echo stops scanning for Home Assistant's Bluetooth devices: the radio cannot do both without the
  music stuttering.
  The phone's volume slider moves the Echo's volume and the other way round, and the action button pauses and resumes
  the phone.
- **One music source at a time.** When a phone starts playing over Bluetooth, Music Assistant pauses (the whole group
  the Echo is in); when Music Assistant starts playing on the Echo, the phone pauses. Verified with Music Assistant and
  a Pixel.
- **Bluetooth proxy for Home Assistant.** The Echo now scans for Bluetooth LE devices and passes what it hears to Home
  Assistant, like an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy. After updating, Home Assistant picks it up by itself: the Echo appears
  under Settings → Devices & services → Bluetooth, and BLE sensors, trackers and beacons in range show up.
  Integrations that have to connect to a device can do so through the Echo too, up to 3 devices at a time, and pair
  with it where the device allows pairing without a PIN (like ESPHome's proxies). Paired devices are remembered across
  restarts. Amazon's Bluetooth service is stopped for this, so the Echo no longer works as a Bluetooth speaker (without
  Alexa nothing could pair with it anyway).

## 2026-09-23

- **No more silent speaker after Alexa's mute.** Amazon's mixer has a global mute that silences every sound whatever the
  volume, and it survives reboots, so an Echo muted under stock Alexa stayed silent under hassmic: no replies, no music,
  no sounds. hassmic now clears it when it finds it set.
- **Replies and music from wherever Home Assistant points.** hassmic may now connect to any address, not only local
  ones, so a Home Assistant reached by a public domain, a Tailscale address or IPv6 works too. Amazon's own services
  stay locked to the local network. Safe now that only the paired Home Assistant can tell the Echo what to fetch.
- **Encrypted connection to Home Assistant.** The ESPHome connection now uses the same encryption as ESPHome devices.
  Home Assistant creates the key by itself when the Echo is added, and from then on only Home Assistant can connect.
  Already added? Home Assistant sets the key on its next connection, nothing to do. See "Encryption key" in the README
  if it ever needs a reset.
- **Replies and music from a Home Assistant with a host name.** The Echo now finds `.local` names (like
  `homeassistant.local`) by mDNS, may ask the DNS servers the network hands out even when one is public (8.8.8.8 from
  DHCP used to be dropped), and tries every address a name resolves to instead of giving up after the first. Before, an
  internal URL with a name instead of an IP could leave the Echo silent at any volume. What still has to hold is in the
  README under "No sound from replies or music?".
- **No more 20 s of deafness after a restart or update.** Amazon's mixer waits for its performance monitor before it opens
  the mic, and the lockdown used to stop that daemon. It now keeps running, so the wake word listens again right after
  hassmic starts.
- **Alexa's original sounds** for the wake word, the action button, the volume keys and the mic-off button (mics off / mics
  on), taken from the stock firmware on the device. The generated blip is gone. The "Wake sound" switch in Home Assistant
  silences all of them.
- **Button sounds no longer drop out.** About a third of them were lost to a race in Amazon's mixer library; playback now
  waits for the mixer to take the sound before closing the stream.
- **Volume stays consistent.** Replies play on a separate volume (`TTSVolume`) that only followed the main volume when
  hassmic changed it. It is now kept in line every 2 s, and a main volume changed from outside is reported to Home
  Assistant and Music Assistant.
- **Diagnostics in Home Assistant**: SoC temperature and CPU usage as sensors, disabled by default. Enable them in the
  entity settings of the Echo Dot device.
- For developers: `kill -TTIN $(pidof hassmic)` writes what the wake word hears to `state/capture.raw`, the next one stops
  it. The only way to record the processed mic stream while hassmic runs.

## 2026-09-22

- **Wake word during alarms and playback.** hassmic now tells Amazon's wake word model when a timer rings, music plays or a
  reply is spoken, and the model switches to the lower accept threshold it carries for those moments ("Echo" needs a score
  of 0.45 instead of 0.75 while an alarm rings). Stopping an alarm or interrupting music by voice works from further away.
